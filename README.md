# Database Application

# Description
This is a simple database GUI application which uses Python's Tkinter as it's GUI and sqlite3 as it's backend database.

# Requirements
#### - In the databaseApp-PythonGUI folder run:
'''
pip install Pillow
'''
Adapt the command to your operating system if needed.

# Usage
For the very first time run the ' **createDatabase.py** ' file.
This will create the database and the required table for the GUI application.

Then run the main file like this:
'''
python3 databaseGUI.py
'''
