# Description
This is a simple database GUI application which uses Python's Tkinter as it's GUI and sqlite3 as it's backend database.

# Requirements
#### - In the databaseApp-PythonGUI folder run:
```
pip install Pillow
```
Adapt the command to your operating system if needed.

# Usage
For the very first time run the ` createDatabase.py ` file.
This will create the database and the required table for the GUI application.

Then run the main file like this:
```
python3 databaseGUI.py
```
